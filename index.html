                    Hello, my name in Emily Rickman and I am a current student at <font color="Gold"><b>University of California Merced</b></font>! <br> 
                    I am a first year Computer Science & Engineering major, looking for new opprotunities in the field and new projects to do! I am studying HTML, Python, and CSS.
                    Outside of school, I enjoy painting, cooking, travelling, and spending time with my family!
