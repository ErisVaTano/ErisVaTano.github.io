                <p>
                    The pokemon clone project is still in progress. Once it is finished the link to the running site will be added here. On this site you will be able to move a character through a small area, encounter and battle pokemon, as well as catching and naming pokemon on your battle team.

                    During high school, I was serving as the PR President for my high school marching band, so I began to develop advertisements for recruitment into the band. This portfolio was developed to collect my advertisements as well as other digital artworks I have created.
